# Poker Playing Neural Network

Poker Playing Neural Network is for people to understand how an all Java implementation of a neural network can work and how a poker AI can be trained with genetic algorithems.

## How To Use This Code

Copy the Java files into an IDE or text Editor if you wish to train your own poker bot and modify the code for yourself. Download the Jar file if you wish to play with a pre-trained poker bot that has seen more poker hands than nierly any human.

### Prerequisites

The computer running this code must already be running java and must have the abuility to compile java code in an IDE or text editor.

## Running the tests
 
 You can run this test by downloading all of the files in this project and coppying the above code into your main java file.

## Deployment

This neural network is free to use with no legal restrictions.
